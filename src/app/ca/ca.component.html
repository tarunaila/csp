        <h2>Chartered Accountancy</h2>
        <p>Chartered accountancy revolves around the study of accounting and taxation procedures to be qualified as a professional who can take care of the accounting and the taxation for a business or a firm. Chartered Accountancy is unlike the regular professionals wherein one needs to attend college to get a degree and then go for Masterâ€™s and PhD. The Chartered Accountancy is a professional degree itself, but it cannot be disintegrated into undergraduate or postgraduate degrees or levels. Rather it is a degree that can be achieved after qualifying the three levels of exams that comes in between the completion of the degree. The three levels include the foundation level, intermediate level and final level. Only after a candidate has qualified all the three levels can they work as a professional chartered accountant.</p>
