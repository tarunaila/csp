        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Merit-based:</span> There are colleges and universities in these courses which offer candidates admissions based on the marks achieved in 10+2. MBBS eligibility criteria are based on competencies gained in 10+2. These colleges often take students using their cut-off lists. But the number of these colleges is very less in numbers and the medical entrance exam is a must for this particular degree.
